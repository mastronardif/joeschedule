Joeschedule Pictures

<h3>Your own Pictures</h3>
<p>
When taking your picutres with your digital camera for activity schedules you want to crop out the unwanted background.  
Usually there is a program that comes with your camera that allows you to do this and other image effects.
<br>
<br>
You can also scan in pictures from childrens books, magazines, your local Artist, photos, etc.
</p>
<p>
I recomend keeping your digital 
pictures for joeschedule in one directory and organizing them with joeschedule via choice boards or schedules.
</p>

</p>
<h3>Your Picture CD</h3>

<p>
If you have Picture CD's I recomend finding the pictures you like from the CD with the CD querying tool, 
and copying them to a single directory on your hard disk and managing them with joeschedule like above.
Also it may be worthwile to purchase a Picture CD with specific pictures of your paticular field of interest,
like PECS, Selfhelp, American Sign Language, Pciture Verbs, etc.  
</p>

<h3>Some places to find pictures</h3>
<p>
Google Images & Yahoo Images, have many pictures of just about any subject.<br />
EBay - good site for Toys and Objects. <br />
Amazon - for book covers and Objects <br />
Store sites like The Gap, Shoprite, KMart, Toys stores.  Good for objects you may find at these stores.<br />
</p>

<p>
Copying pictures from the Web or Locally uses the same technique.
You move your mouse over the picture and right-click and select the properties from the menu.  You will see the 
Address URL for example	<i>file:///G:/fxm/pics/00temp/DSCF0005.JPG</i> if its local or
<i>http://images.vnunet.com/v6_image/ca/pics/25pin.gif</i> if its from the web.  Once you copy the url you can put the picture 
in one of you schedules.
</p>

<h3>Picture sizes.</h3>
<p>
There are basically two image types that we're interested in <i>.jpg</i> and .<i>gif</i>.
The <i>.jpg</i> are usally photos and are larger in size.
The <i>.gif</i> files are usually smaller in size with less detail.
For the purpose of joeschedule you should try to get a picture which is specific in detail with not much background.
Also you should get a picture which is small in size around 20k.
If you can not tell what the picture is by glancing at it, is not a good picture for a schedule.  Also if it does not
print well do not use it, if the schedule is to be printed.
<p>
Also the larger the size, the longer it can take to download from the internet.
</p>



<h3>Finale Note</h3>
<p>
In general you want to keep the picture simple with little distratction as possible.  Work with your pupil 
and note the pictures that he/she likes and follows.  Of course every person is a little different, but when you 
find out what works, stick with those type of pictures.
